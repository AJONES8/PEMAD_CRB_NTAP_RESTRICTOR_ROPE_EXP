# 2022 NTAP Restrictor Rope Reserch Repository

Analysis of data collected by NTAP field work on the F/V Darana R in Spring 2022 and Fall 2022. For this experiment paired tows were made to assess the impact of a restrictor rope on catches and net geometry. Work in this format is aimed at better understanding the potential application of this type of gear to better standardize trawl gear performance.
